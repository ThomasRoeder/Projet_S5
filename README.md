# Projet_S5

After downloading the project, create a file named "version.py" in the "main" folder with the version number in the form of "v1.4" for example.
This file will be updated at every update, and should not be added to github. The number will follow the name of the tags.

The file ReceiveAndSend.py is the file for the server and should not stay in the same folder.
